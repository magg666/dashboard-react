## Technologies
Main:
* React
* html, css

Libraries:
* Apexcharts
* Material-ui
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* Google api (gapi)


## Setup
Use package.json to download all needed dependencies, npm runserver.

## Code Examples
Class based components:
```javascript
export default class WeatherWidget extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            currentDayWeather: {
                time: null,
                temperature: null,
                summary: "",
                icon: "",
                humidity: null,
                pressure: null,
                windSpeed: null,
            }
        }
    };
```
Functional components with Google api:
```javascript
export const Calendar = (props) => {
    // initial state
    let [eventsList, setEvents] = useState([]);

    function handleClientLoad() {
        gapi.load('client:auth2', checkAuth)
    }

    function checkAuth() {
        gapi.auth2.authorize({
            client_id: props.clientId,
            scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar',
            immediate: true,
            prompt: 'none'
        }, handleAuthResult)
    }
```
Custom hooks:
```javascript
export function useInterval(callback, delay) {
        const savedCallback = useRef();

        useEffect(() => {
            savedCallback.current = callback;
        }, [callback]);

        useEffect(() => {
            function tick() {
                savedCallback.current();
            }

            if (delay !== null) {
                let id = setInterval(tick, delay);
                return () => clearInterval(id);
            }
        }, [delay]);
    }
```

## Features
Codecool Dashboard uses:
* Class based components
* Functions components
* Standard and custom hooks
* External Apis
